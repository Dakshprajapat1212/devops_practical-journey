# Complete Notes: Day-19 | Jenkins ZERO to HERO

This session walks you through Jenkins setup, pipeline creation, integrations, hands-on projects, and interview preparation. You will learn to install Jenkins on AWS EC2, configure Docker agents, define pipelines as code, integrate with SonarQube, deploy applications to Kubernetes using Helm and ArgoCD, and review common Jenkins interview questions.

## Repository Structure

The Jenkins-Zero-To-Hero GitHub repository organizes code and examples for learning CI/CD with Jenkins. It contains:

- java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s  
- python-jenkins-argocd-k8s  
- multi-stage-multi-agent  
- my-first-pipeline  
- shared-libraries  
- vars  
- Interview_Questions.md  

These folders demonstrate progressively advanced pipeline techniques and real-world integrations.

---

## Installation and Setup

- Launch an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu).  
- Update package lists and install Java JDK 17:  
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
  ```  
- Add Jenkins apt repository and key:  
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key \
    | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
  echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ \
    | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install jenkins
  ```  
- Open inbound port 8080 in the EC2 security group.  
- (Optional) Add the Jenkins user to the Docker group for agent builds.  

By default, Jenkins will listen on port 8080; access it via `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080`.

## Jenkins Architecture

Jenkins follows a master-agent model:

- **Master (Controller)** manages job scheduling, user interface, and orchestration.  
- **Agents (Slaves)** run build jobs and report back results.  

Agents can run on Docker containers, VMs, or bare-metal servers.

---

## Pipelines as Code

Jenkins pipelines enable defining build workflows in a `Jenkinsfile` stored alongside your source code.

- **Freestyle Pipelines** use a GUI to configure steps but lack version control.  
- **Declarative Pipelines** use a structured syntax with `pipeline {}` block.  
- **Scripted Pipelines** are Groovy scripts for full programmatic control.  
- **Multi-stage, multi-agent** pipelines break workflows into stages that run in parallel on different agents.  

Pipelines as code improve reproducibility, reviewability, and collaboration.

---

## Integrations

### Docker Agents

- Use the Docker plugin to spin up agent containers on demand.  
- Isolate build environments and ensure consistency across builds.  

### SonarQube

- Add a SonarQube analysis stage for static code quality checks.  
- Fail the pipeline if code coverage or quality gates are not met.  

### Helm, Kubernetes & ArgoCD

- Package applications into Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments.  
- Leverage ArgoCD for GitOps-driven releases, automatically syncing manifests from Git to clusters.  

These integrations model modern DevOps workflows and GitOps practices.

---

## Hands-On Projects

### Java Maven Spring Boot CI/CD

- Clone the `java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s` project.  
- Build with Maven and run unit tests.  
- Perform SonarQube analysis.  
- Package into a Docker image and push to a registry.  
- Deploy to Kubernetes via Helm charts and ArgoCD.  

### Python Django CI/CD

- Use the `python-jenkins-argocd-k8s` folder for a Django todo app.  
- Execute Python linting and tests in a Jenkins stage.  
- Containerize the app, apply Kubernetes manifests, and let ArgoCD handle GitOps deployment.  

Both examples illustrate end-to-end pipeline flows from code commit to production rollout.

---

## Shared Libraries and Pipeline Variables

- The `shared-libraries` directory holds reusable Groovy libraries that can be imported into multiple pipelines.  
- The `vars` folder defines custom steps and global variables to keep Jenkinsfiles concise and DRY.  

Using shared libraries promotes maintainability and standardization across teams.

---

## Multi-Stage Multi-Agent Pipelines

- Breakdown pipelines into logical stages (e.g., Build, Test, Package, Deploy).  
- Assign specific agents to stages based on required tools or environments.  
- Achieve parallel execution to reduce total pipeline runtime.

The `multi-stage-multi-agent` example demonstrates this pattern in practice.

---

## Interview Preparation

Key questions and topics from `Interview_Questions.md` include:

- Jenkins architecture and the role of master vs. agents.  
- Differences between Declarative and Scripted pipelines.  
- How to configure and use Docker agents.  
- Methods to secure credentials and sensitive data.  
- Steps to integrate and enforce SonarQube quality gates.  
- Implementing GitOps with Helm and ArgoCD.  
- Best practices for pipeline versioning and shared libraries.  

Reviewing these Q&A helps reinforce core concepts and ready you for DevOps interviews.

---

## Best Practices & Tips

- Store Jenkinsfiles in the same repository as your code.  
- Prefer Declarative pipelines for clarity and error handling.  
- Use shared libraries to avoid repeating boilerplate across projects.  
- Secure secrets with the Credentials plugin and avoid hardcoding values.  
- Regularly update plugins and Jenkins itself to patch vulnerabilities.  
- Monitor agent health and clean up unused workspaces.  

Adopting these practices leads to reliable, maintainable CI/CD workflows.
