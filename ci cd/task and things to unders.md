build real ci cd for application  try argo cd sometime , can also ansible
for cd

build artifacts

deploy artifacted directly on kubernates  
----


ansible is cm by good its can deploy code 

but using argo cd more benfits 

cause is modern day cd application


and if u argocd its tool for cd , not just deploy  also can montior the state inside kubernates clusters


anibnle just deploy what u storing in helm chrts 





if use argocd  tool what they do is they will ensure satte is always , cause kubernates controler they are








there is application deploy it




watch it oits immppppp

Absolutely! Let‚Äôs break down everything Abhishek explains **after the [50:00](#timestamp-00:50:00) mark**, especially the part about **ArgoCD and Kubernetes**, in a clear and detailed way so you can understand it fully.

## üß† What‚Äôs Happening on Screen (After 50:00)

Abhishek transitions from Jenkins pipelines to **real-world CI/CD deployment using Kubernetes and ArgoCD**. Here's what you see and what it means:

### üñ•Ô∏è On-Screen Visuals
- He shows a **Python-based To-Do application** stored in a GitHub repo.
- Displays a **Kubernetes cluster** where the app will be deployed.
- Shows **ArgoCD UI**, which monitors and manages Kubernetes deployments.
- Demonstrates how Jenkins can trigger a deployment to Kubernetes using ArgoCD.

---

## üîç What Abhishek Explains (Step-by-Step)

### [00:50:00](#timestamp-00:50:00) **Why ArgoCD Is Better Than Ansible for Kubernetes**
- **Ansible** is a configuration management tool. It can deploy apps to Kubernetes, but it doesn‚Äôt monitor them afterward.
- **ArgoCD**, on the other hand, is a **GitOps tool** designed specifically for Kubernetes:
  - It continuously watches your GitHub repo.
  - If your repo says the app should be version 3, ArgoCD ensures the cluster runs version 3.
  - If someone manually changes the cluster to version 2, ArgoCD will revert it back to version 3.

### [00:50:45](#timestamp-00:50:45) **Declarative vs Procedural Deployment**
- **Ansible** is procedural: it runs commands and stops.
- **ArgoCD** is declarative: it maintains the desired state automatically.
- ArgoCD acts like a **Kubernetes controller**, running inside the cluster and constantly syncing with GitHub.

### [00:51:00](#timestamp-00:51:00) **CI/CD Flow with Jenkins + ArgoCD**
- Jenkins pulls the code from GitHub.
- Builds the application (e.g., Python To-Do app).
- Pushes the updated Kubernetes manifests (like `deployment.yaml`) to GitHub.
- ArgoCD detects the change and deploys the new version to the cluster.

### [00:51:30](#timestamp-00:51:30) **Benefits of This Setup**
- Fully automated deployment pipeline.
- No manual intervention needed after Jenkins pushes code.
- ArgoCD ensures consistency between GitHub and Kubernetes.
- Ideal for modern microservices architecture.

## üß© Key Concepts Simplified

| Concept            | What It Means                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GitOps**         | Managing infrastructure and apps using Git as the source of truth             |
| **ArgoCD**         | A Kubernetes-native tool that syncs your cluster with GitHub automatically    |
| **Declarative**    | You define the desired state; the system ensures it stays that way            |
| **Procedural**     | You write step-by-step instructions; no automatic correction or monitoring    |
| **Jenkins + ArgoCD** | Jenkins builds and pushes code ‚Üí ArgoCD deploys and monitors it             |

---

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters

This setup is **highly scalable**, **cost-efficient**, and **production-ready**. It‚Äôs used by companies like Netflix, Intuit, and Red Hat to manage thousands of microservices.

If you want, I can walk you through creating a Jenkins pipeline that integrates with ArgoCD, or help you write a sample `deployment.yaml` file for Kubernetes. Just say the word!
