## üß† Real-World Example

Imagine you're a **bank** or **government agency**:
- You can't risk storing code on public servers.
- You need to control who accesses what.
- You want to integrate GitHub with internal tools like Jira, LDAP, or custom CI/CD systems.

GitHub Enterprise lets you do all that while still using the GitHub interface your developers love.
