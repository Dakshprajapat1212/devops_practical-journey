Great observation 👌 You noticed that:
	•	In the YouTube video:

NAME       STATUS   ROLES                AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane,master  26m   v1.23.3


	•	On your setup:

NAME       STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
minikube   Ready    control-plane   10m   v1.34.0



⸻

📝 Why the Difference?

🔹 Older Kubernetes Versions (< v1.24)
	•	They showed both roles:

control-plane,master


	•	“master” was the old naming convention.

⸻

🔹 Newer Kubernetes Versions (v1.24+)
	•	The Kubernetes community removed the word master because it was outdated terminology.
	•	Now only:

control-plane

is shown.

You’re on v1.34.0, so it follows the newer naming convention.
The video is on v1.23.3, so it still shows the old format.

⸻

✅ Bottom Line
	•	No problem with your setup.
	•	It’s just a difference between Kubernetes versions.
	•	Functionally, they are the same — it’s still your control-plane node running.

⸻

👉 So your output is correct for the latest Kubernetes release.
