Yes, absolutely! When you deploy a **Deployment YAML** in Kubernetes, it **automatically creates a ReplicaSet (RS) controller** behind the scenes. Here's how it works step by step:

### üß© What Happens When You Apply a Deployment YAML

- **Deployment Controller** reads your YAML and understands:
  - Desired number of replicas (`replicas: 3`, for example)
  - Pod template (what kind of pods to create)
  - Labels and selectors (how to track those pods)

- It then **creates a ReplicaSet** to manage those pods:
  - The RS ensures that the specified number of pods are always running.
  - If a pod crashes or is deleted, RS spins up a new one using the same template.

- The **ReplicaSet is owned by the Deployment**, meaning:
  - You don‚Äôt need to manually manage RS.
  - During updates, the Deployment may create a **new RS** and gradually shift traffic (rolling update).

### üîÅ Why This Matters

- You get **self-healing**: RS ensures pod availability.
- You get **version control**: Deployment can roll back to previous RS.
- You get **clean abstraction**: You manage the Deployment, and it manages RS + Pods.

### üß† Bonus Insight (for your debugging mindset)

Even if the pod IP changes (as mentioned in your service discovery notes), the RS keeps the labels consistent. That‚Äôs why **Services use labels/selectors**, not IPs, to track pods‚Äîbecause RS ensures label continuity even when pods are replaced.

Let me know if you want to dry-run a sample YAML and trace how RS gets created under the hood. I can walk you through it in Hindi too if you'd prefer.


Absolutely Daksh! Here's a crisp, exam-ready note based on the video segment starting at [00:17:18](#timestamp-00:17:18) from Abhishek Veeramalla‚Äôs Day-35 Kubernetes Services class.

## üìò Kubernetes Service ‚Äì Discovery via Labels & Selectors

### üîπ Problem Recap
- Pods are ephemeral: when they restart, their IP changes.
- Even with auto-healing, new pods get new IPs.
- If services tracked pods by IP, they‚Äôd break when IPs change.

---

### üß† Solution: Labels & Selectors

| Concept         | Role in Service Discovery |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Label**       | Tag assigned to pods (e.g., `app: payment`) |
| **Selector**    | Service watches for pods with matching labels |
| **ReplicaSet**  | Ensures new pods have same labels |
| **Service**     | Routes traffic to pods using labels, not IPs |

---

### üîß How It Works

```yaml
# Pod Template
metadata:
  labels:
    app: payment

# Service Spec
spec:
  selector:
    app: payment
```

- Service ignores IPs.
- Watches for pods with label `app: payment`.
- Even if pod dies and restarts, label remains same.
- Service auto-discovers new pod and routes traffic.

### üß† Interview Insight

> ‚ÄúHow does Kubernetes Service handle dynamic pod IPs?‚Äù  
Answer: By using **labels and selectors**, not IP addresses. This enables **service discovery** and ensures traffic always reaches the correct pods.

## üìò Kubernetes Service ‚Äì Full Concept Breakdown

### üîπ What is a Service?
A **Service** in Kubernetes is a stable endpoint that exposes a set of Pods to the network. It handles:
- **Load balancing** across Pods
- **Service discovery** using labels/selectors
- **Stable access** even when Pod IPs change
- **External exposure** (if needed)

---

## üß† Why Do We Need Services?

### ‚ùå Without Service:
- Pods have dynamic IPs (change after restart)
- Clients break when IP changes
- Manual IP tracking is error-prone

### ‚úÖ With Service:
- Stable DNS name (e.g., `payment.default.svc.cluster.local`)
- Auto-routing to healthy Pods
- Load balancing + discovery via labels

---

## üîß How Service Works

```yaml
Deployment ‚Üí ReplicaSet ‚Üí Pods
                      ‚Üë
                   Service
```

- Service watches Pods using **labels**
- Uses **selectors** to route traffic
- Ignores IP changes‚Äîfocuses on labels

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Kubernetes Services

| Type           | Description                                                                 | Access Scope             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `ClusterIP`    | Default. Internal access only.                                               | Within cluster only      |
| `NodePort`     | Exposes service on static port of each node.                                | Within organization      |
| `LoadBalancer` | Provisions external IP via cloud provider.                                  | Public internet access   |

---

## üß™ Service YAML Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: payment-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: payment
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: NodePort
```

- `selector`: Matches Pods with label `app: payment`
- `port`: Port exposed by service
- `targetPort`: Port inside Pod
- `type`: Determines exposure level

---

## üöÄ Key Features of Service

### 1. **Load Balancing**
- Evenly distributes traffic across Pods
- Uses kube-proxy internally

### 2. **Service Discovery**
- Tracks Pods via labels, not IPs
- Auto-updates when Pods restart

### 3. **External Exposure**
- `NodePort` ‚Üí internal network
- `LoadBalancer` ‚Üí public IP (cloud only)

Want me to convert this into a printable diagram-style note or add CLI commands for each service type? I can also walk you through a dry-run demo with `kubectl expose` and `kubectl get svc`. Just say the word.





why-->>>  if no service in kuberna
ts



<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 11 33 27‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a970b46-c1e0-41f3-9601-1ae6251e3550" />


assume ther is  3 replica 1,2,3



ex-therer is 10 concurant user people are trying acces something in same time



if one pods gets all load people ared tryinf only to acces pods or application 1 its gets 




what we do we create replica , and replica depends on no. of user trying to acces

 and depend on no. of a pods a connection can take , and no of request can acces 


 so based on creates pods 

 so if we decides ideal count for replica -so depend on requessts ,,,if 1 podsa can - acces 10 , and have 100 ysers so bases on that we defie


<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 11 58 21‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/600d0f24-e704-4870-8238-71634ee1abe3" />




 lets suppose we have 3 pods wthe peronlem is that there could  like  one pods goes down is very common 


so kubernates  provide auto  healing for that 

 if  pods goes down it will not come automatically

 conatner and pods are emphjhernal



 untill u have auto healing nehaviour in rs controller








 lets suppose as soon this pods goes ,,'


rs says leet me create one more copy even before the acutual one is deeted and parrele





and let suppose old pods was ip 17.22.2.1

and when new pods creratesd ip will change 17.22.2.2






so whats happends the application came up but ip is cahnages 


now talking abut scener no service




ahave to share ip test team  app and who usingg this app  and creating another project to add this



lets suppose ther is 3 team  trying to acces pods all are getting diff  ip
<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 12 13 03‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7ae1249-4f92-4e51-a03b-bec9124a9ceb" />





even we have autohealing ip is chnages 


and ip is new


and this user 1 or team 
and trying  to test applicstion and application is not accesbisle and not working and but for devops enginner its working 




after debugging he is trying to send old ip but now ip is new 

and neither he is wrong and nor the devops 

and this is  the problema and real life this is not the things we work on

like google  never tells use this ip or tjis

<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 09 14‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed7bb89c-2bc0-4c4e-84ce-9f4e33fdbb36" />

but its possible google does load balancing



and we create a deploymet serivce(svc) and what we do and insteead to acces a ip  lik there is 3 ip for 3 pods 




<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 09 30‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b21e1a0-1e50-4fd8-a143-6f950ac12ba7" />



ther is 3 project user 1 and user 2 and user 3 trying to aces using ip   ,, but when ip changes its error





so insetead giving ip to each user


we create a svc top of the deploymenet



using this we use load baalncing 
and this is done by kube proxy






<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 18 28‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a78eaf23-2000-4716-812c-a4de156aa177" />


like if this is payment application
we can use default name and this is will acces any of active pods using load baalancing
also

<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 23 01‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a8e8824-ef45-4b32-8fcf-5d78251ef4b4" />



kube proxy is forwarsd the request 
if 10 request coming ssend response 10 


<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 23 50‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/624de4b2-f078-4faf-9078-1c3423d8a97a" />


if  there woulnt be service tere would be terrible issue


but request are coming from the serivce and still the ip changes for the pods its also for the svc 

then how it send the  request to particular ip how load balancing knows this ip which is new 
<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 35 58‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5a5d7c2-1416-4ca2-beb1-dc503828a93c" />





svc->

1.load balancing







2. service discovery->> if im  a keep a track of deployment which is cretaing three pods f or exa and one of ip is chanages and serivce also faces same problemn keeping track of ip , so what serivce said that i wil not bother ip add at all , i will come with new procces called labeles and selectors   
 
<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 44 47‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21b0deab-7e7b-463c-b1f9-8d9015ae0f1e" />


lables and selcectors-->> for every pods thtis creatted devops enginner or devloper apply lables 

<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 1 45 46‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0be06f1b-46c4-40af-9f0e-337a0dad7135" />


this label will be common for the all the pods 



lets say this is paymnet label and service only carea bout pods specified with the label called paymentss

i will not bother about ip addres i only watch pods with labels <img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 3 23 09‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a8f2bad-0360-492c-a99f-0878cfee81f0" />

even a old pods delete and new ip comes still the label would be same

cause rs controller deploy  new pods same yml its got , if a serice keep track of pods  using labels instead of ip , and labels is alwyas same so the pronlem is solved


this is svc discsovery mechansim is done using labels and selectors


--------

end  mechaniscim ---



<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 3 30 52‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bd37f99-2901-40f7-b5eb-d46248835c48" />


what we will fom today learninf - we will create service offer load baalncinf  keeps track of label , whenerve new pods creates with same label and its keep track of new pods and its maintain the service discovery







3.  what a service can a do also

  --> expose to world


  


see whenever we are creating a deployment

the pods that crewated the pods came up with new ip , by accesing it using master and ssh


who ever has acces the kubernates cluster it can minicube , eks kops , they can login into the kuernats cluster and they can hit the appplicationn


its not real life application like dont ask ssh the macchinede


<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 3 39 54‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/128c36f2-08a7-4fed-96a9-211b21f0749e" />

we just use google.com  , this is something that kubernates can do directly using the deployment





service ->>can expose-> allows outisde the k8s cluster 


how-> whenervre we are taking kubernates service in yml manefests we are provided  with 3 serivce


yml-->
<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 4 03 38‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14180277-5f36-4ba8-a922-3c27efd23275" />

1.cluster ip->if u are creating a service usinng the mod the cluter ip mode so this will be by defualt behaviour so application still be accesible insde the kubernates cluster

2.nodeport->alows application to inside org 

they have worker node ip addres  so 

whowver have acces of woker node ip addrs 
only they can havr aces of application if they creatye  usinf nodeport


3.load balancer-> servcice will expose to extrnal word


tjis workd only on cloud provider 

eks->> elastic load balancing ip addres, and pop;e can use this ip addres every where in the world(public ip addres))




<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 4 23 06‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ade6484-9d96-4cff-9779-7c9ce1d0f9f8" />



<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 4 31 05‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd1ff518-396b-4123-aaa9-f8195846bdba" />




------------------------------

kubenates cluster

created deployment ,rs,pods are insidethe worker node 1 


in the node create a service on top of it



svc will watch for pods



<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 4 37 44‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ec010bf-4ad9-4118-aec4-6e31ae6218ab" />

user flow depends on types of service 



case 1 . clustr ip- who have ip of this cluster can acces only the application







user   outisde the orgaainsiation  ,, cant reach the applicatinn cause application is onlyfor orahnsiaation
<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 4 56 36‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0581b6f9-9932-4f25-b0cd-9bfeeeb2faea" />

2.load balancer->>

aws--> eks-> elb-> public ip ADDRES  

the  cloud conterler manger ccm of kubernates does this 


<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 5 00 18‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b3afc6c-0d02-4bd6-99c0-a848da4c7197" />

anybody can acces this 


<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 5 00 50‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d83107bb-7e70-42ed-9272-c9bdfec3d28d" />




nodeport-->>who cna acces the worker node can accces the application



ec2 ip addres have can acces the application

<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-02 at 5 03 36‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26af5238-8a29-49a4-aee2-15b3964c0647" />
