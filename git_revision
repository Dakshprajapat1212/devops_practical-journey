## 🧠 Git & GitHub Revision Notes — Practical Guide

### 1. **What Is Git?**
- Git is a **distributed version control system**.
- It tracks changes in files and lets multiple developers collaborate safely.
- Think of it as a **time machine** for your code.

---

### 2. **What Is GitHub?**
- GitHub is a **cloud platform** that hosts Git repositories.
- It adds collaboration tools like pull requests, issue tracking, and CI/CD.
- Git is the tool; GitHub is the place where you use it with others.

### 3. **How Git Works Internally**

| Zone               | Role                                 | Command Example            |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Working Directory  | Where you edit files                 | `vim cal.sh`               |
| Staging Area       | Prepares files for commit            | `git add cal.sh`           |
| Repository         | Stores committed snapshots           | `git commit -m "msg"`      |

---

### 4. **Common Git Commands**

| Action                  | Command                          | What It Does                            |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Initialize repo         | `git init`                       | Starts Git tracking in current folder   |
| Check status            | `git status`                     | Shows tracked/untracked/staged files    |
| Stage file              | `git add <file>`                 | Prepares file for commit                |
| Commit changes          | `git commit -m "message"`        | Saves snapshot to history               |
| Push to GitHub          | `git push origin main`           | Uploads commits to remote repo          |
| Rollback changes        | `git restore <file>`             | Reverts file to last committed state    |
| View history            | `git log`                        | Shows commit history                    |

---

### 5. **Untracked vs Staged vs Committed**

- **Untracked**: Git sees the file but isn’t tracking it yet.
- **Staged**: You’ve added it with `git add`, ready to commit.
- **Committed**: You’ve saved it to Git’s history.

🧪 Example:
```bash
touch cal.sh
git status          # shows cal.sh as untracked
git add cal.sh
git status          # shows cal.sh as staged
git commit -m "Add cal.sh"
```

---

### 6. **Why Commit Is Important**
- Commits are **checkpoints**.
- Without commits, you can't rollback, branch, or collaborate.
- Think of commits like **save points in a game** — you can always return to them.

---

### 7. **What Happens If You Modify Without Committing**
- Git still sees the changes in your working directory.
- But they’re not saved to history.
- You can rollback using:
  ```bash
  git restore <file>
  ```

---

### 8. **Using `git commit -am`**
- Shortcut for committing modified **tracked** files:
  ```bash
  git commit -am "Quick update"
  ```
- Doesn’t work for **new files** — you still need `git add`.

---

### 9. **Setting Up a Main Repo on a Server (Pre-GitHub Days)**

```bash
# On server
mkdir /srv/git/project.git
cd /srv/git/project.git
git init --bare

# On client
git clone ssh://user@server:/srv/git/project.git
```

- Developers pushed/pulled via SSH.
- GitHub later simplified this with web UI and collaboration tools.

---

### 10. **SSH Access Troubleshooting**

If you see:
```bash
Permission denied (publickey)
```

✅ Check:
- Correct username (`ubuntu`, not `ubutnu`)
- Key file permissions: `chmod 400 devops3.pem`
- Matching key pair in AWS EC2
- Security group allows SSH (port 22)

### 🧠 Real-Life Analogies

| Git Concept        | Analogy                            |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Working Directory  | Your desk — editable papers         |
| Staging Area       | Folder of selected pages            |
| Commit             | Filing the folder into a cabinet    |
| Push               | Sending the cabinet to the cloud    |
| Rollback           | Pulling out an old draft            |

Got it! Based on the Git status message you just learned:

---

## 🧠 Git Concept: `modified` Status

### 🔍 What It Means
- When you run `git status`, and see:
  ```bash
  modified: cal.sh
  ```
  it means you've **changed the file `cal.sh`**, but haven't staged it yet.

### 🛠️ Key Actions
- **To include the changes in your next commit:**
  ```bash
  git add cal.sh
  ```
- **To discard the changes and revert to the last committed version:**
  ```bash
  git restore cal.sh
  ```

### 📌 Summary
| Status     | Meaning                                 | Next Step                     |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `modified` | File has been edited but not staged      | Use `git add` or `git restore` |
