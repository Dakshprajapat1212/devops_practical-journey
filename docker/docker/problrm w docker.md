Yes, you're absolutely right—this **is a backend server**, and the error you're seeing is coming from the Django backend itself. But let’s clarify exactly *why* this is happening:

---

## 🧠 Why You're Getting `404 Not Found` in the Terminal

Your Django app is running inside the container and acting as a backend server. When you visit:

```
http://13.233.250.115:8000/
```

Django receives a request for the root path `/`. It then checks its routing configuration (`urls.py`) to see if there's a view mapped to `/`. But according to the error message:

> “Using the URLconf defined in `devops.urls`, Django tried these URL patterns, in this order:  
> `demo/`  
> `admin/`  
> The empty path didn’t match any of these.”

This means:
- The app is only configured to respond to `/demo/` and `/admin/`
- There is **no route for `/`**, so Django returns a 404 error
- Because `DEBUG = True` in your settings, Django logs this error in the terminal

---

## 🧾 Why This Happens in a Backend Server

Backend servers like Django are responsible for:
- Receiving HTTP requests
- Matching them to defined routes
- Executing logic and returning responses

If a request comes in for a route that isn’t defined (like `/` in this case), the backend correctly returns a `404 Not Found`. This is **expected behavior**, not a bug.

---

## ✅ What You Can Do

### 1. Visit the Correct Route
Try accessing:
```
http://13.233.250.115:8000/demo/
```
That’s the route Django is configured to serve.

### 2. Add a Route for `/` (Optional)
If you want the app to respond to `/`, update `devops/urls.py` like this:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('demo.urls')),  # 👈 This makes '/' serve demo app
    path('demo/', include('demo.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```

Then rebuild your Docker image and rerun the container.

---

## 🔄 Summary

- You're seeing the error because the backend server (Django) doesn't have a route for `/`
- The container is working perfectly—it’s just running the app as-is
- This is a **developer-side configuration**, not a DevOps issue
- You can either use `/demo/` or patch the routing to support `/`

Docker is powerful, but like any tool, it comes with its own set of challenges. Let’s break down the **most common problems with Docker**, especially from a DevOps or developer perspective:

---

## ⚠️ Common Problems with Docker

### 1. **Security Risks**
- Containers share the host kernel—if one container is compromised, it could affect the host.
- Running containers as **root** can be dangerous.
- Public images from Docker Hub may contain vulnerabilities if not verified.

### 2. **Networking Complexity**
- Docker’s virtual networks (bridge, overlay, host) can be confusing.
- Port conflicts and misconfigured firewalls can block container communication.
- DNS resolution between containers sometimes fails without proper setup.

### 3. **Storage & Volume Issues**
- Data inside containers is ephemeral—if the container dies, data is lost unless volumes are used.
- Mounting volumes between host and container can cause permission errors.
- Volume cleanup is often overlooked, leading to disk bloat.

### 4. **Image Size & Build Time**
- Large base images (like full Ubuntu) slow down builds and deployments.
- Improper layering in Dockerfiles can lead to bloated images.
- Caching issues during `docker build` can cause unexpected behavior.

### 5. **Resource Management**
- Containers can consume too much CPU or memory if not limited via cgroups.
- Docker doesn’t automatically clean up stopped containers or unused images—manual pruning is needed.

### 6. **Debugging & Logging**
- Logs are container-specific and can be hard to trace across services.
- Debugging inside containers is tricky—especially if they crash immediately.
- Tools like `docker exec` help, but aren’t always enough for deep inspection.

### 7. **Compatibility & Versioning**
- Docker Desktop versions may differ from Docker Engine on Linux servers.
- Image version mismatches across environments can cause “works on my machine” issues.
- Docker Compose files may behave differently across versions.

---

## 🧠 Real-World Example

Let’s say you pull the `ubuntu` image and run a container:

```bash
docker run -it ubuntu
```

If you try to install a package and get a permission error, it’s likely because:
- You’re not using `apt update` first.
- Or the container lacks root privileges.
- Or the network settings are blocking access to package mirrors.

---

## 🧰 How to Mitigate These Problems

- Use **minimal base images** like `alpine` for faster builds.
- Always scan images with tools like **Trivy** or **Clair**.
- Set resource limits in `docker run` or Compose files.
- Use **named volumes** for persistent data.
- Clean up regularly: `docker system prune -a`
- Use **multi-stage builds** to keep final images lean.
