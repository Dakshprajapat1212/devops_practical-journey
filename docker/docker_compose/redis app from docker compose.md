Great questions 🙌 Let’s go one by one:

⸻

🔹 What is Redis Client?
	•	Redis is an in-memory database / cache used to store key-value pairs.
	•	In Node.js, we use the redis library to connect to a Redis server.
	•	redis.createClient({ host: 'redis', port: 6379 }) creates a Redis client object that allows Node.js to:
	•	get values from Redis,
	•	set values in Redis,
	•	basically talk to the Redis server.

Think of it like:
👉 Redis client = remote control for talking to the Redis database.

⸻

🔹 Code Breakdown

redisClient.get('numVisits', function(err, numVisits) {

	•	redisClient.get('numVisits', ...)
→ Reads the value stored under the key "numVisits" from Redis.
Example: If Redis has { numVisits: 5 }, then numVisits = "5".
	•	The second parameter function(err, numVisits) is a callback:
	•	err → error (if Redis fails to respond).
	•	numVisits → the current value of "numVisits" from Redis.

⸻


numVisitsToDisplay = parseInt(numVisits) + 1;

	•	Converts the value from string to number (since Redis stores values as strings).
	•	Then increments it by 1.

⸻


if (isNaN(numVisitsToDisplay)) {
  numVisitsToDisplay = 1;
}

	•	If "numVisits" was not found in Redis (i.e., null), then parseInt(null) is NaN.
	•	In that case, set the first visit count to 1.

⸻


res.send(os.hostname() + ': Number of visits is: ' + numVisitsToDisplay);

	•	Sends a response to the browser.
	•	os.hostname() → returns the name of the machine/container running this code.
	•	This is helpful if multiple containers are running (like in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes). You can see which container served your request.

⸻


numVisits++;
redisClient.set('numVisits', numVisits);

	•	Increments the visit count and saves it back into Redis.
	•	This ensures the counter is stored centrally in Redis, not in Node.js memory.
	•	So even if the server restarts, the counter value is preserved.

⸻

🔹 Why use os here?
	•	os is a built-in Node.js module that gives system-level information.
	•	os.hostname() gives the server’s name.
	•	In Docker, every container has a unique hostname.
	•	By showing os.hostname(), you can confirm which container handled your request.

👉 This is super useful for load balancing demonstrations (like with Nginx + multiple Node.js containers).

⸻

⚡ So in simple words:
	•	redisClient is your link to Redis.
	•	This block of code checks the stored counter, increases it, sends the result back to the browser, and updates Redis again.
	•	os.hostname() is just used to show which container/server responded.

⸻

Do you want me to also draw a small flow diagram (Browser → Node.js → Redis → Response) so you can visualize how the request flows?




Excellent question 👍

In the screenshot you shared, the Redis server is not inside this server.js code — it’s running as a separate service, most likely defined in the docker-compose.yml.

⸻

🔹 Where is Redis actually running?
	•	In normal setup: Redis runs on your computer or a remote server, listening at localhost:6379 (default port).
	•	In this example:
	•	The Redis server is another container managed by Docker Compose.
	•	In the docker-compose.yml, there will be a service named redis.
	•	Because all services in a Docker Compose project share the same internal network, your Node.js app can simply connect to Redis using host: 'redis'.

⸻

🔹 Example docker-compose.yml (simplified)

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: ./web
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - redis

  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"

Here:
	•	web → your Node.js app (server.js runs inside this container).
	•	redis → a separate container running official Redis.

When you write in code:

const redisClient = redis.createClient({
  host: 'redis',
  port: 6379
});

👉 "redis" is not just a string — it’s the service name from docker-compose.yml. Docker’s internal DNS will resolve it to the Redis container’s IP.

⸻

🔹 So the Redis server is:

✅ Running inside a Redis container (launched by Docker Compose).
✅ Accessible to Node.js app (web service) through hostname redis on port 6379.

⸻

Would you like me to show you the exact docker-compose.yml file that goes with this code so you can see how web and redis connect?



                 Yes ✅ you’re absolutely right!

Redis is mainly used for fast lookup and storage because:
	•	It keeps data in RAM (memory) instead of on disk → so reads/writes are super fast (microseconds).
	•	It stores data as key–value pairs (like a big dictionary).

⸻

🔹 Why Redis is fast
	1.	In-memory database → No slow disk I/O.
	2.	Efficient data structures → supports strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, etc.
	3.	Single-threaded event loop → avoids context switching overhead.
	4.	Optional persistence → it can dump data to disk, but lookup is still from memory.

⸻

🔹 Common Uses of Redis
	•	Cache: Store results of expensive operations (e.g., API calls, DB queries).
	•	Session storage: Store user sessions for web apps.
	•	Real-time counters: Like the "numVisits" example in your code.
	•	Pub/Sub system: For chat apps, notifications.
	•	Leaderboards / Queues: Using sorted sets and lists.

⸻

👉 In your example, Redis is being used for a real-time counter.
Each time someone hits the page, the app quickly looks up "numVisits", increments it, and stores it back → much faster than querying a traditional SQL database every time.

⸻

Do you want me to also compare Redis vs a normal database (like MySQL/Postgres) in terms of speed and use cases? That’ll make the “fast lookup” part super clear.








                 Exactly 👍 You’ve got the idea, let me make it super clear:

⸻

🔹 Where Redis stores data
	•	Unlike MySQL/Postgres (which store data on disk as a permanent database),
	•	Redis stores everything in RAM (machine’s memory) → that’s why it’s so fast.

👉 So yes — Redis keeps data outside of the traditional DB and directly in the machine’s memory.

⸻

🔹 But wait… what if the machine restarts? 🤔
	•	By default, if Redis only uses memory → all data is lost when Redis stops or machine restarts.
	•	But Redis supports persistence (saving to disk):
	•	RDB snapshots (periodic dump of memory to disk).
	•	AOF (Append Only File) (logs every write to disk).
	•	With persistence turned on, Redis reloads the data into memory on startup.

⸻

🔹 How it works in your example
	•	Your Node.js app (server.js) asks Redis: “Hey, what’s the current numVisits?”
	•	Redis looks into its in-memory store and replies instantly.
	•	If the app increments the counter, Redis updates it in memory (and maybe writes to disk depending on config).

⸻

⚡So in short:
	•	Redis is like a super-fast, memory-based storage system.
	•	It can act as a cache (temporary fast storage) or even as a database (with persistence).

⸻

Would you like me to show you a diagram (Browser → Node.js → Redis (RAM)) so you can visualize how Redis sits “outside” the main DB but inside the machine memory?
                 Awesome question Hannu 🔥 You’re now thinking about the plumbing of how Redis actually connects and stores that visit count. Let me break it down clearly:

⸻

1. Where is the “visit” count stored?
	•	In your code, we have:

redisClient.set('numVisits', numVisits);

👉 This saves a key–value pair into Redis:

Key:   "numVisits"
Value: 7   (or whatever the count is)

So the visit count is stored inside the Redis server’s memory (RAM of the machine/container where Redis is running).

⸻

2. How does Node.js connect to that server?

In your server.js:

const redisClient = redis.createClient({
  host: 'redis',
  port: 6379
});

	•	host: 'redis' → This is the hostname of the Redis server.
	•	In Docker Compose, redis is the service name → Docker’s internal DNS resolves it to the Redis container’s IP.
	•	If you weren’t using Docker, you would put the machine’s IP or localhost.
	•	port: 6379 → Default Redis port.

So your Node.js app (web service) connects to the Redis server (redis service) over the Docker network.

⸻

3. Which machine is this Redis running on?
	•	If you run Docker locally → Redis is running inside a container on your machine.
	•	If you deploy to cloud → Redis could run inside a cloud VM or a managed Redis service (like AWS ElastiCache, Azure Cache for Redis, etc.).

But in every case:
👉 The “visit” is stored in the memory of the machine/container running Redis.

⸻

4. Why not store in Node.js memory?

If you just did:

let numVisits = 0;

	•	Then each Node.js server would keep its own separate counter in memory.
	•	If you scaled your app to 3 containers → each one would have a different counter.
	•	If the app restarts → the counter resets to 0.

That’s why we use Redis:
✅ Central place for all servers to read/write visit count.
✅ Shared across multiple servers/containers.
✅ Optionally persistent.

⸻

⚡ Flow looks like this:

Browser → Node.js (web container) → Redis (redis container) → Returns updated count
