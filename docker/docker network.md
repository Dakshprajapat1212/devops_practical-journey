# What Is `docker0`?

`docker0` is the **default bridge network interface** Docker creates on the host whenever you install Docker. It’s essentially a virtual Ethernet switch that lets containers—and the host—talk to each other, even if they’re on different subnets.

---

## How `docker0` Works

1. **Virtual Ethernet Bridge**  
   - Docker spins up a Linux bridge device named `docker0` on the host.  
   - It acts like a software switch, connecting multiple “veth” (virtual Ethernet) interfaces.

2. **veth Pair for Each Container**  
   - When you start a container, Docker creates a **veth pair**:
     - One end is attached to the container’s `eth0`.
     - The other end is plugged into the host’s `docker0` bridge.  
   - This lets the container send packets to `docker0`, which then forwards them to either the host’s network stack or other containers on the same bridge.

3. **Subnet Isolation & Routing**  
   - By default, `docker0` is assigned a private subnet (e.g., `172.17.0.0/16`).  
   - Containers get IPs from this range (e.g., `172.17.0.2`, `172.17.0.3`).  
   - The host’s physical interface (`eth0`, say `192.16.3.4`) is on a different subnet.  
   - Without `docker0`, containers and the host couldn’t communicate directly because their network portions differ.

---

## Quick Diagram

```
[ Host eth0: 192.16.3.4 ]
           │
        docker0 (bridge)
         ┌──┴──┐
         │     │
[ C1 eth0: ]vethA│172.17.0.2
[ C2 eth0: ]vethB│172.17.0.3
```

- C1/C2 talk to each other via `docker0`.
- C1/C2 talk to the host via `docker0` (even though host’s `eth0` is on `192.16.x.x`).

---

## Inspecting `docker0`

On Linux, you can run:
```bash
ip addr show docker0
```
You’ll see something like:
```
3: docker0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 scope global docker0
    ...
```
- `inet 172.17.0.1/16` → the bridge’s IP and subnet mask.

---

## Why It Matters

- **Default Connectivity:** Without creating custom networks, all containers join `docker0` by default and can freely communicate.  
- **Security & Isolation:** To isolate sensitive services, you can create additional user-defined bridge networks—breaking them off from `docker0` so containers on different bridges cannot see each other without explicit routing.

> **Next Steps You Might Explore**  
> - Creating and inspecting custom bridge networks (`docker network create …`).  
> - Examining veth pairs with `ip link` inside the container namespace.  
> - Mapping container ports to the host via `-p` so external clients can access your apps through `docker0`.

# Day-28 video notes: Docker networking (bridge, host, overlay) by Abhishek Veeramalla

You want the whole thing, clean and practical. Here are detailed, diagram-backed notes that map to what he explains and demos.

---

## Overview and learning goals

- Docker networking lets containers talk to each other and to the host, with options for open communication or strong isolation depending on your needs.
- Default is bridge networking via a virtual ethernet bridge (docker0), enabling traffic between host and containers across different subnets.
- Alternatives: host networking (fast, but insecure) and overlay (multi-host/cluster use cases; covered briefly).

By the end, you’ll know:
- What eth0 and docker0 are
- How default bridge works
- How to create custom bridge networks for isolation
- What host networking does
- How to verify with docker inspect and ping tests.

> He positions this as core Docker networking and a stepping stone before Kubernetes; interview questions follow in the next class.

---

## Core concepts explained

- **Container-host split:**
  - Host has its own interface (eth0) with an IP (e.g., 192.16.3.4 in his sketch).
  - Container gets an IP from Docker’s default bridge subnet (e.g., 172.17.0.2).
  - These are different subnets; direct ping fails unless bridged.

- **Bridge networking (default):**
  - Docker auto-creates a virtual ethernet bridge called docker0 (“veth”) so containers can talk to the host despite subnet difference.
  - All containers attached to the default bridge can reach each other and the host via docker0.

- **Host networking:**
  - Container uses the host’s network stack directly. No separate container IP is assigned in inspect; it “binds” to host networking.
  - Fast but considered insecure because isolation reduces; anyone with host access effectively reaches the container’s network path.

- **Overlay networking:**
  - For multi-host clusters (Swarm/Kubernetes). Not needed for single-host Docker demos; he postpones deep dive to K8s context.

- **Security/isolation motivation:**
  - Default bridge means a common path for all containers. Sensitive services (e.g., “finance”) should be on a separate custom bridge to reduce lateral movement risk.

> He frames two scenarios: containers must talk (frontend-backend), and containers must be isolated (login vs finance). Docker networks support both.

---

## Diagrams of traffic flow

#### Default bridge networking (everyone on docker0)
```
[ Host (eth0: 192.16.3.4) ]
          |
       [docker0]  <-- virtual bridge
        /     \
 [C1: 172.17.0.2]  [C2: 172.17.0.3]

- C1 <-> C2: OK (same bridge)
- C1/C2 <-> Host: OK via docker0
```
This matches his demo where login and logout containers get 172.17.x IPs and can ping each other.

#### Custom bridge for isolation (split the paths)
```
[ Host (eth0) ]
     |                 |
 [docker0]         [secure-network]
    |                      |
 [login]               [finance]

- login (bridge) cannot reach finance (secure-network)
- Both still can reach Host through their own bridges
```
He creates a custom bridge “secure-network” and attaches the finance container to it, breaking the common path.

#### Host networking (no separate container IP)
```
[ Host network stack ]
       ^
   [container]
- No separate container IP in docker inspect
- Shares host network
```
He shows docker inspect for host mode: network=host and no separate IP listed.

> These reflect his whiteboard flow and CLI verification via inspect/ping.

---

## Live demo walkthrough (commands and what to expect)

#### 1) Spin up two containers on default bridge and verify connectivity
```bash
# Start
docker run -d --name login nginx
docker run -d --name logout nginx

# Get IPs
docker inspect login   | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress'
docker inspect logout  | jq -r '.[0].NetworkSettings.Networks.bridge.IPAddress'

# Exec into login, install ping, and ping logout
docker exec -it login bash
apt update && apt install -y iputils-ping
ping <LOGOUT_IP>
```
- Expected: Both get 172.17.0.x addresses (bridge). Ping from login to logout succeeds.

> He demonstrates docker ps, docker inspect, installing ping, and shows 172.17.0.2 vs 172.17.0.3 with successful ping.

#### 2) List networks and create a custom bridge
```bash
docker network ls

# Create custom bridge
docker network create secure-network

docker network ls
```
- Expected: You see bridge, host, none, and now secure-network (type bridge).

#### 3) Run a finance container on the custom bridge and test isolation
```bash
docker run -d --name finance --network=secure-network nginx

# Inspect networking
docker inspect finance | jq '.[0].NetworkSettings.Networks'

# From login container, try ping finance
docker exec -it login bash
ping <FINANCE_IP>
```
- Expected: finance gets an IP in a different subnet (he shows 172.19.x), and ping from login fails, demonstrating isolation between the default bridge and custom bridge.

> He explicitly shows finance on “secure-network” with 172.19.x and the ping attempt failing from login.

#### 4) Host networking demo
```bash
docker run -d --name host-demo --network=host nginx
docker inspect host-demo
``]
- Expected: Network mode shows host. No separate container IP in inspect output, because it binds to host network directly.

> He cautions that host mode is the most insecure approach in Docker networking due to shared network exposure.

---

## Key takeaways and mental models

- Default Docker network is a bridge (docker0). It exists so containers on a different subnet (e.g., 172.17.x) can still reach the host (e.g., 192.16.x) via a virtual bridge.
- All containers on the same bridge can reach each other by IP; great for service-to-service, risky for sensitive workloads.
- For isolation, create a custom bridge and attach sensitive containers to it; by default, containers on different user-defined bridges won’t talk across bridges unless you configure routing/iptables.
- Host networking removes network isolation; only use when you truly need the performance/behavior and understand the blast radius.
- Overlay is for multi-host clusters; learn it alongside Kubernetes or Swarm, not for single-host basics.

> He repeatedly contrasts “talk to each other” vs “isolate strongly” and shows how bridge/custom-bridge solve both.

---

## Handy commands cheat sheet

- List networks
  - docker network ls
- Create custom bridge
  - docker network create secure-network
- Run with specific network
  - docker run -d --name finance --network=secure-network nginx
- Inspect container network/IP
  - docker inspect <name> | jq '.[0].NetworkSettings.Networks'
- Host mode
  - docker run -d --name host-demo --network=host nginx

> He uses these exact flows in the demo to show IP ranges and connectivity behavior.

---

## Interview-ready nuggets (from his framing)

- Explain why docker0 exists and how it bridges different subnets by default.
- Compare bridge vs host vs overlay, including security implications.
- Describe how to isolate a sensitive service (custom bridge; prove via ping tests and docker inspect).
- Justify when host mode is acceptable and the risks involved.
