An AWS Load Balancer is like a smart traffic cop for your cloud infrastructure üö¶. Its job is to **distribute incoming network traffic** across multiple targets‚Äîsuch as EC2 instances, containers, or Lambda functions‚Äîto ensure your application stays **available, scalable, and resilient**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è What AWS Load Balancers Do

- **Distribute traffic**: Spread incoming requests across multiple servers to avoid overloading any single one.
- **Monitor health**: Continuously checks the health of targets and routes traffic only to healthy ones.
- **Scale automatically**: Adjusts capacity based on traffic volume.
- **Secure access**: Supports SSL/TLS termination and integrates with security groups.
- **Route intelligently**: Uses rules to route traffic based on URL paths, host headers, or query strings.

### üß† Types of AWS Load Balancers

| Type                     | Layer | Best For                              | Key Features                                      |
|--------------------------|-------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Application (ALB)**    | L7    | Web apps (HTTP/HTTPS)                  | Path-based routing, host-based routing, SSL offload |
| **Network (NLB)**        | L4    | High-performance TCP/UDP traffic       | Ultra-low latency, static IP, TLS support         |
| **Gateway (GLB)**        | L3    | Third-party virtual appliances         | Transparent network gateway                       |
| **Classic (CLB)**        | L4/L7 | Legacy apps                            | Basic load balancing, limited features            |

### üì¶ Real-World Example

Imagine you have a website hosted on three EC2 instances. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will:
- Accept incoming HTTP requests
- Check which EC2 instances are healthy
- Route each request to the best available instanceGreat question! AWS Load Balancers distribute **incoming and outgoing traffic** based on several smart decision-making factors. Here's how they decide where to send requests:

### ‚öñÔ∏è How AWS Load Balancers Distribute Traffic

#### 1. **Listener Rules**
- Each load balancer has **listeners** that check for incoming connections.
- Listener rules define **conditions** (like URL path or host header) and **actions** (like forward to a target group).
- Example: Requests to `/api/*` go to backend A, while `/images/*` go to backend B.

#### 2. **Target Groups**
- Targets (like EC2 instances) are grouped.
- Load balancer forwards traffic to targets in the group based on health and availability.

#### 3. **Routing Algorithms**
- **Round Robin**: Evenly distributes traffic across all healthy targets.
- **Least Outstanding Requests** (ALB only): Sends traffic to the target with the fewest active requests.
- **IP Hash** (NLB only): Routes based on client IP for session stickiness.

#### 4. **Health Checks**
- Load balancer continuously checks if targets are healthy.
- Unhealthy targets are **automatically skipped** until they recover.

#### 5. **Cross-Zone Load Balancing**
- If enabled, traffic is distributed **across all Availability Zones**.
- If disabled, each zone handles its own traffic only.

### üîÅ Outgoing Traffic?

Technically, load balancers **don‚Äôt manage outgoing traffic** from your backend servers. They only handle **incoming client requests** and route them to the appropriate backend. Outgoing responses follow the same path back through the load balancer to the client.
