Absolutely! Here's a complete and organized set of notes summarizing everything we've discussed about your Terraform configuration:

## ðŸ§¾ Terraform Configuration Breakdown

### 1. **Terraform Block**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.16"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.2.0"
}
```

- **Purpose**: Sets up Terraform's environment.
- **`required_providers`**: Specifies AWS as the cloud provider and locks the version to 4.16 or newer.
- **`required_version`**: Ensures Terraform CLI version is at least 1.2.0.

---

### 2. **Provider Block**

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

- **Purpose**: Tells Terraform which AWS region to use.
- **`region`**: `us-west-2` refers to Oregon, USA.

---

### 3. **Resource Block**

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "app_server" {
  ami           = "ami-830c94e3"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform_Demo"
  }
}
```

- **Purpose**: Creates an EC2 virtual machine (server) on AWS.
- **`aws_instance`**: Resource type for EC2.
- **`"app_server"`**: Logical name used to reference this instance in Terraform.
- **`ami`**: ID of the Amazon Machine Image (defines OS and software).
- **`instance_type`**: `t2.micro` is a small, low-cost instance type.
- **`tags`**: Metadata for the instance.

---

### 4. **Tag Explanation**

```hcl
tags = {
  Name = "Terraform_Demo"
}
```

- **`Name`**: A special AWS tag that sets the display name of the instance in the AWS Console.
- **`"Terraform_Demo"`**: The value assigned to the `Name` tag â€” helps identify the instance easily.

## ðŸ§  Summary

This Terraform script:
- Uses AWS as the cloud provider.
- Operates in the Oregon region (`us-west-2`).
- Creates one EC2 instance named `app_server`.
- Uses a specific AMI and a small instance type (`t2.micro`).
- Tags the instance with `Name = "Terraform_Demo"` for easy identification.
