## 🧠 Git Branching Strategy – Practical Notes

### 🌱 What Is Branching in Git?
- Branching allows developers to work on **different features, fixes, or experiments** independently.
- The `main` or `master` branch is usually the **production-ready** code.
- Other branches are used for development, testing, or staging.

### 🧩 Common Branch Types

| Branch        | Purpose                                      |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `main` / `master` | Stable production code                     |
| `dev`         | Active development and integration            |
| `feature/*`   | Individual features or enhancements           |
| `bugfix/*`    | Fixes for specific bugs                       |
| `release/*`   | Prepares code for release                     |
| `hotfix/*`    | Urgent fixes for production issues            |

### 🔄 Typical Workflow

1. **Start from `dev` branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feature/login
   ```

2. **Work on your feature**:
   - Make changes
   - Stage and commit:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add login feature"
     ```

3. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/login
   ```

4. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Merge `feature/login` into `dev`
   - After testing, merge `dev` into `main`

### 🚨 Why Use Branching Strategy?

- Keeps production code stable
- Enables parallel development
- Simplifies testing and code reviews
- Makes rollback and hotfixes easier

---

### 🧠 Real-World Analogy

Imagine a team writing a book:
- `main` = final published version
- `dev` = working draft
- `feature/*` = chapters being written
- `release/*` = edited version ready for print
- `hotfix/*` = typo fixes after publishing

---

### 🧪 Interview Tip

If asked in a DevOps interview:
> “Describe your Git branching strategy.”

You can say:
> “We follow a structured branching model with `main` for production, `dev` for integration, and feature branches for isolated development. We use pull requests for code review and merge into `main` only after thorough testing.”
