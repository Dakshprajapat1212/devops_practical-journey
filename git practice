## 🚀 Git Workflow: Tracking `cal.sh` in a New Repository

### 📁 Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository

```bash
git init
```

- Creates an empty Git repository in `.git/`
- You are now on the `master` branch
- No commits exist yet

---

### 📝 Step 2: Create and Edit a File

```bash
vim cal.sh
```

- You opened `cal.sh` in Vim and likely added some content
- If you try to run `cal.sh` directly like `cal.sh`, it fails because:
  - It’s not marked executable
  - It’s not in your `$PATH`

To fix that:
```bash
chmod +x cal.sh
./cal.sh
```

---

### 🗑️ Step 3: File Deletion and Recreation

```bash
rm cal.sh
vim cal.sh
```

- You deleted `cal.sh` and then recreated it
- Git still sees it as a **new untracked file**

---

### 📌 Step 4: Check Git Status

```bash
git status
```

Output:
- You're on `master`
- No commits yet
- `cal.sh` is **untracked**
- Many other files are also untracked

---

### ✅ Step 5: Stage the File

```bash
git add cal.sh
```

Now `cal.sh` is staged for commit.

```bash
git status
```

Shows:
- `cal.sh` is ready to be committed
- Other files remain untracked

---

### 🧾 Optional: Commit the File

```bash
git commit -m "Add cal.sh script"
```

This will:
- Create your first commit
- Save `cal.sh` to the repository history

---

## 🧠 Notes

- To unstage `cal.sh`:  
  ```bash
  git rm --cached cal.sh
  ```

- To track other files:  
  ```bash
  git add <filename>
  ```

- To add everything:  
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
