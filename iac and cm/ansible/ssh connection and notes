# 🧠 DevOps with Ansible – Practical Notes & Doubt Clarifications

## 📍 Day 15 Summary – Ansible Zero to Hero

---

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### ✅ Installing Python & Pip
- Installed Python:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3
  ```
- Installed pip:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install python3-pip
  ```
- Removed pip later:
  ```bash
  sudo apt purge python3-pip -y
  sudo apt autoremove -y
  ```

### ✅ Installing Ansible
- Recommended method: use system package manager
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ansible
  ```
- Verified with:
  ```bash
  ansible --version
  ```

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: Why not install Ansible using pip?  
✔️ Answer: Pip-based installs may require manual path setup and are less reliable across OS. Package managers (apt, brew, choco) are simpler and safer.

---

## 🔐 Passwordless SSH Setup

### ✅ Steps:
1. Generate SSH key:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen
   ```
2. Copy public key to target server:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   → Paste into `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on target server
3. Verify:
   ```bash
   ssh <target-ip>
   ```

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: Is this the same as GitHub SSH setup?  
✔️ Answer: Yes, same `ssh-keygen` process. But for GitHub, the public key goes into your GitHub account settings. For Ansible, it goes into the target server’s `authorized_keys`.

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: What is RSA and `-t` in `ssh-keygen`?  
✔️ RSA is an encryption algorithm. `-t` specifies the key type (e.g., RSA, ed25519). RSA is widely supported, but ed25519 is more modern and secure.

---

## 📁 Inventory File

### ✅ Purpose:
- Stores IPs or hostnames of target servers.
- Can group servers:
  ```ini
  [webservers]
  192.168.1.10

  [dbservers]
  192.168.1.20
  ```

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: Why group servers?  
✔️ To run playbooks or commands on specific sets of machines (e.g., only webservers).

---

## 🧪 Ad-Hoc Commands

### ✅ Syntax:
```bash
ansible -i inventory all -m shell -a "touch devops_class"
```
- `-i`: inventory file
- `-m`: module (e.g., `shell`, `copy`)
- `-a`: arguments (actual command)

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: Why use ad-hoc commands instead of playbooks?  
✔️ Use ad-hoc for quick tasks. Playbooks are better for structured, repeatable automation.

---

## 📜 Writing Your First Playbook

### ✅ Example: Install and Start Nginx
```yaml
---
- name: Install and Start Nginx
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```
- Saved as `firstplaybook.yaml`
- Run with:
  ```bash
  ansible-playbook -i inventory firstplaybook.yaml
  ```

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: What does `become: yes` do?  
✔️ It runs tasks with root privileges (like using `sudo`).

---

## 🧠 Understanding Modules

### ✅ Common Modules:
| Module   | Purpose                     |
|----------|-----------------------------|
| `shell`  | Run shell commands           |
| `apt`    | Install packages (Debian)    |
| `service`| Start/stop services          |
| `copy`   | Copy files between servers   |

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: How to find modules and arguments?  
✔️ Use [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/index_module.html) to explore modules and examples.

---

## 🧱 Ansible Roles

### ✅ Purpose:
- Organize complex playbooks into reusable components.

### ✅ Create a Role:
```bash
ansible-galaxy init kubernetes
```

### ✅ Role Structure:
| Folder      | Purpose                                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `tasks/`    | Main tasks                                |
| `handlers/` | Error handling or notifications           |
| `templates/`| Jinja2 templates                          |
| `vars/`     | Variables                                 |
| `defaults/` | Default variables                         |
| `meta/`     | Metadata and licensing                    |
| `files/`    | Static files (e.g., certs, configs)       |
| `tests/`    | Unit tests for playbooks                  |

> 🔎 **Doubt You Asked**: Why use roles instead of one big playbook?  
✔️ Roles improve readability, maintainability, and scalability—especially for large setups like Kubernetes.

---

## 🧭 Bonus Tips

- Use `-v`, `-vv`, or `-vvv` for verbose/debug mode.
- Use `ansible --help` and `ansible-doc <module>` for quick reference.
- Always test playbooks on staging before production.
