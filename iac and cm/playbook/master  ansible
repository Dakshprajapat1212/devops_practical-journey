# 🚀 Ansible Mastery Task List for DevOps Success

## 🧱 Foundation Tasks (Beginner Level)

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ Install Ansible | Use `apt`, `yum`, or `brew` depending on OS. Verify with `ansible --version`. |
| ✅ Setup EC2 Instances | Create at least two Linux EC2 instances on AWS for practice. |
| ✅ Configure Passwordless SSH | Generate SSH keys and copy public key to target servers for seamless access. |
| ✅ Create Inventory File | Define target hosts and groups in a `.ini` or `.yaml` inventory file. |

## ⚙️ Core Skills (Intermediate Level)

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 📂 Run Ad-Hoc Commands | Use modules like `shell`, `copy`, `ping`, `file`, etc. for quick tasks. |
| 📜 Write Playbooks | Automate multi-step tasks like installing packages, starting services. |
| 🧪 Use Verbosity Flags | Run playbooks with `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`, `-vvvv` to debug and learn internals. |
| 🧩 Explore Modules | Learn key modules: `apt`, `yum`, `service`, `copy`, `template`, `user`, etc. |
| 🧠 Understand Facts | Use `gather_facts` to collect system info and use it in playbooks. |

## 🧠 Advanced Automation (Pro Level)

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🧱 Create Roles | Use `ansible-galaxy init <role-name>` to structure reusable playbooks. |
| 🧪 Write Handlers | Trigger actions based on task changes (e.g., restart service if config changes). |
| 🧰 Use Variables & Templates | Create dynamic playbooks using Jinja2 templates and variable files. |
| 🔐 Secure Secrets | Use `ansible-vault` to encrypt sensitive data like passwords and keys. |
| 🧪 Test Playbooks | Use Molecule or manual testing to validate playbook behavior. |

## 🌐 Real-World Projects (Job-Ready)

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ☁️ Provision Infrastructure | Use Terraform to create EC2s, then configure with Ansible. |
| 🧭 Configure Kubernetes Cluster | Use Ansible to set up master and worker nodes. |
| 📦 CI/CD Integration | Integrate Ansible with Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated deployments. |
| 📊 Monitoring Setup | Use Ansible to install and configure Prometheus, Grafana, or ELK stack. |
| 🧹 System Hardening | Automate security tasks: firewall setup, user management, patching. |

## 🧪 Interview Prep & Practice

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🗂️ Build a GitHub Portfolio | Upload playbooks, roles, and project examples. |
| 📚 Study Common Questions | Understand differences between ad-hoc vs playbook, modules vs roles, etc. |
| 🎯 Mock Projects | Simulate real-world tasks like setting up a LAMP stack or deploying a web app. |
