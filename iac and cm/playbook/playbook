Yes! When you use specific keywords in Ansible‚Äîlike `apt`, `yum`, or `service`‚Äîyou‚Äôre actually calling **modules** that know how to perform those tasks on the target machine. These modules are like smart tools that do the work for you, and yes, they work online because they often need to fetch packages from the internet.

Let‚Äôs break it down with your example: installing **Nginx**.

## üß† What Happens When You Use a Specific Keyword Like `apt`

### ‚úÖ Playbook Example:
```yaml
- name: Install and Start Nginx
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
```

### üîç What Each Keyword Does:
- `apt`: This module tells Ansible to use Ubuntu‚Äôs package manager to install something.
  - It goes online to fetch the latest version of `nginx` from the official repositories.
- `service`: This module manages services like starting, stopping, or restarting them.
  - It uses system commands like `systemctl start nginx` behind the scenes.

## üåê Why It Works Online
- When you run this playbook, Ansible connects to the target machine via SSH.
- The `apt` module uses the internet to download Nginx.
- The `service` module starts Nginx locally after installation.

So yes‚Äî**specific keywords (modules)** like `apt`, `yum`, `service`, `copy`, etc., are what make Ansible powerful. They abstract away the complexity and let you automate tasks with just a few lines.

Would you like me to show you how to install other tools like Docker or Node.js using Ansible modules? Or maybe how to write a playbook that installs multiple packages at once?
