# Why the Hyphens in Ansible YAML?

Whenever you see a hyphen (`-`) in an Ansible playbook, it’s not a decorative dash—it’s YAML syntax for **list items**. Ansible playbooks are YAML files, and lists are fundamental to how playbooks, tasks, handlers, plays, and more are defined.

## 1. Document Start: Triple Dash (`---`)

```yaml
---
- name: Install and Start Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    # …
```

- The three hyphens at the very top (`---`) mark the **beginning of a YAML document**.
- They aren’t strictly required by every parser, but they’re a best practice to signal “this is YAML.”

---

## 2. Plays as List Items

```yaml
- name: Install and Start Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    # …
- name: Configure Firewall
  hosts: firewalls
  tasks:
    # …
```

- Each top-level `- name:` indicates a **play** in a playbook.
- A play is one set of instructions against one or more hosts.
- Hyphens here separate multiple plays in the same file.

## 3. Tasks as List Items

```yaml
tasks:
  - name: Install Nginx
    apt:
      name: nginx
      state: present

  - name: Start Nginx
    service:
      name: nginx
      state: started
```

- Under the `tasks:` key, the hyphens denote each **task** in order.
- YAML treats everything under `tasks:` as a list, so each task needs its own list indicator.

## 4. Other Lists

You’ll also see hyphens for:

- **Handlers**:
  ```yaml
  handlers:
    - name: Restart Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
  ```
- **Roles inclusion**:
  ```yaml
  roles:
    - common
    - webserver
  ```
- **Loop items**:
  ```yaml
  with_items:
    - nginx
    - curl
    - git
  ```

---

## Quick Takeaway

- Single hyphen (`-`) means “here starts a new item in this list.”
- Triple hyphens (`---`) mark the start of your YAML document.
- In Ansible, lists power plays, tasks, handlers, roles, loops, and more.

By understanding the hyphens as **YAML list syntax**, you’ll read and write Ansible playbooks more confidently—and avoid syntax errors when adding your next task.
