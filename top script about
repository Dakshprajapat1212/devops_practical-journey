Got it, Hannu — let’s break this top output into plain, no-confusion parts so you know exactly what each number means.

⸻

1. First line — System uptime & load

top - 15:13:30 up 48 min,  5 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

	•	15:13:30 → Current system time.
	•	up 48 min → System has been running for 48 minutes since last boot.
	•	5 users → Number of users currently logged in (includes SSH sessions, terminals, etc.).
	•	load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 → CPU load over:
	•	Last 1 minute → 0.00
	•	Last 5 minutes → 0.00
	•	Last 15 minutes → 0.00
(0.00 means CPU was completely idle. A load of 1.00 means 100% busy on a single-core CPU.)

⸻

2. Second line — Task summary

Tasks: 118 total,   1 running, 117 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie

	•	118 total → Total number of processes.
	•	1 running → Processes actively using CPU.
	•	117 sleeping → Processes waiting/idling until needed.
	•	0 stopped → Processes paused/stopped (e.g., via SIGSTOP).
	•	0 zombie → Processes that finished but haven’t been fully cleaned up (good: none here).

⸻

3. Third line — CPU usage

%Cpu(s):  0.0 us,  0.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st

Breakdown of CPU time in the last refresh cycle:
	•	us = 0.0 → % in user space (normal programs).
	•	sy = 0.3 → % in system/kernel space.
	•	ni = 0.0 → % in user space with nice priority (background low-priority jobs).
	•	id = 99.7 → % idle time (CPU not doing anything).
	•	wa = 0.0 → % waiting for I/O (e.g., slow disk/network).
	•	hi = 0.0 → % servicing hardware interrupts.
	•	si = 0.0 → % servicing software interrupts.
	•	st = 0.0 → % stolen by hypervisor (VM host using CPU time).

⸻

4. Fourth line — Memory usage

MiB Mem :    957.4 total,    326.4 free,    357.4 used,    430.3 buff/cache

	•	957.4 total → Total system RAM.
	•	326.4 free → Completely unused memory.
	•	357.4 used → Memory in active use by programs.
	•	430.3 buff/cache → Memory used for disk cache/buffers (can be freed if apps need it).

⸻

5. Fifth line — Swap usage

MiB Swap:      0.0 total,      0.0 free,      0.0 used.    599.9 avail Mem

	•	0.0 total → No swap space configured.
	•	0.0 used → Swap not being used.
	•	599.9 avail Mem → Amount of RAM available for starting new applications without swapping.

⸻

💡 Key takeaway for your numbers:
	•	Your CPU is almost fully idle (99.7% idle).
	•	Memory usage is light — more than 300 MiB truly free and ~430 MiB in cache.
	•	No swap is set up, but plenty of RAM is available.
	•	System load is basically zero — machine is very free.

⸻

That line in top is the column header — it tells you what each column below means.
Let’s break it down:

Column	Meaning
PID	Process ID — unique number given to each running process.
USER	Username of the process owner.
PR	Priority — how important the process is to the scheduler (lower number = higher priority).
NI	Nice value — a user-adjustable priority hint (-20 = highest priority, 19 = lowest).
VIRT	Virtual memory used by the process (includes all code, data, and shared libraries, whether in RAM or swap).
RES	Resident memory — the part of VIRT actually in physical RAM.
SHR	Shared memory — amount of RES that can be shared with other processes (e.g., shared libraries).
S	State of the process:

	•	R = running
	•	S = sleeping (idle but waiting for something)
	•	I = idle kernel thread
	•	D = uninterruptible sleep
	•	Z = zombie (dead but not cleaned up) |
| %CPU | Percentage of CPU time the process is using right now. |
| %MEM | Percentage of physical RAM the process is using. |
| TIME+ | Total CPU time the process has used since it started (minutes:seconds.tenths). |
| COMMAND | Name (or command) that started the process. |

⸻
Hannu, analyzing the output of that script is exactly the kind of DevOps skill you need —
it’s not about memorizing commands, but about reading the results and knowing what they mean for system health.

Let’s break it down step-by-step.

⸻

1. CPU Usage Section

>> CPU Usage:
Used: 15.2%

	•	What to check:
	•	If CPU usage is consistently above 80%, the server may be overloaded.
	•	Identify why → check “Top 5 Processes by CPU” below.
	•	Possible actions:
	•	Kill/restart runaway processes.
	•	Scale resources (more CPU cores in cloud).

⸻

2. Memory Usage Section

>> Memory Usage:
Used: 3000MB / 8000MB (37.50%)

	•	What to check:
	•	If usage > 85%, memory pressure could cause swapping (slow performance).
	•	Possible actions:
	•	Restart memory-hogging processes.
	•	Add RAM if persistent.

⸻

3. Disk Usage Section

>> Disk Usage:
Used: 45G / 100G (45%)

	•	What to check:
	•	If usage > 90%, the server may crash when writing logs/files.
	•	Check which directory is using space → du -sh /* | sort -h.
	•	Possible actions:
	•	Clear old logs, temp files, or expand disk.

⸻

4. Top 5 Processes by CPU

PID   COMMAND    %CPU
1234  java       50.0
2345  nginx      10.2
...

	•	What to check:
	•	High CPU here explains high total CPU usage above.
	•	Possible actions:
	•	Restart or optimize the heavy process.

⸻

5. Top 5 Processes by Memory

PID   COMMAND    %MEM
5678  mysqld     35.5
6789  node       20.1
...

	•	What to check:
	•	If one process dominates RAM, it might have a memory leak.
	•	Possible actions:
	•	Restart, optimize queries, or allocate more memory.

⸻

6. OS Version

Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS

	•	Why it matters:
	•	Helps when applying patches or debugging OS-specific issues.

⸻

7. Uptime

up 5 days, 3 hours

	•	Why it matters:
	•	If uptime is short → server restarted recently → check for crash logs.

⸻

8. Load Average

 0.12, 0.25, 0.30

	•	Meaning:
	•	Three numbers = load over last 1, 5, 15 minutes.
	•	If any number > CPU cores, the server is overloaded.

⸻

9. Logged In Users

3

	•	Why it matters:
	•	Unexpected users → possible unauthorized access.

⸻

10. Failed Login Attempts

12

	•	Why it matters:
	•	High number may mean brute-force attack.
	•	Check /var/log/auth.log for source IPs.

⸻

How to Study & Report This

When you run this script, don’t just read numbers —
ask yourself:
	1.	Is it healthy or critical? (threshold check)
	2.	If critical, what is the likely cause?
	3.	What immediate action is needed?
	4.	What long-term fix could prevent it?

⸻

If you want, I can turn this into a DevOps “System Health Report Template” so that whenever you run scripts like this, you know exactly what to write in a health check report — just like real DevOps engineers in MNCs.

Do you want me to prepare that?

💡 In your example:

1557 ubuntu  20  0  12328  5588  3540 S  0.0  0.6  0:01.28 top

	•	PID: 1557 → process ID of top
	•	USER: ubuntu → you’re the owner
	•	PR: 20 → normal priority
	•	NI: 0 → nice value not changed
	•	VIRT: 12328 KB → virtual memory size
	•	RES: 5588 KB → RAM in use
	•	SHR: 3540 KB → shared memory
	•	S: S → sleeping (refreshing every 3 seconds)
	•	%CPU: 0.0 → not currently using CPU
	•	%MEM: 0.6 → using 0.6% of RAM
	•	TIME+: 0:01.28 → total CPU time used
	•	COMMAND: top → program name

⸻

If you want, I can also give you a visual map of how VIRT, RES, and SHR relate in memory — that’s the part most beginners find tricky.

If you want, I can also make a color-coded diagram of top output so you can instantly know what each section means when you see it in real-time. That would make it stick forever.
