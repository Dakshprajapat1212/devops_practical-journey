Got it, Hannu â€” letâ€™s break this top output into plain, no-confusion parts so you know exactly what each number means.

â¸»

1. First line â€” System uptime & load

top - 15:13:30 up 48 min,  5 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00

	â€¢	15:13:30 â†’ Current system time.
	â€¢	up 48 min â†’ System has been running for 48 minutes since last boot.
	â€¢	5 users â†’ Number of users currently logged in (includes SSH sessions, terminals, etc.).
	â€¢	load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 â†’ CPU load over:
	â€¢	Last 1 minute â†’ 0.00
	â€¢	Last 5 minutes â†’ 0.00
	â€¢	Last 15 minutes â†’ 0.00
(0.00 means CPU was completely idle. A load of 1.00 means 100% busy on a single-core CPU.)

2. Second line â€” Task summary

Tasks: 118 total,   1 running, 117 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie

	â€¢	118 total â†’ Total number of processes.
	â€¢	1 running â†’ Processes actively using CPU.
	â€¢	117 sleeping â†’ Processes waiting/idling until needed.
	â€¢	0 stopped â†’ Processes paused/stopped (e.g., via SIGSTOP).
	â€¢	0 zombie â†’ Processes that finished but havenâ€™t been fully cleaned up (good: none here).

3. Third line â€” CPU usage

%Cpu(s):  0.0 us,  0.3 sy,  0.0 ni, 99.7 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st

Breakdown of CPU time in the last refresh cycle:
	â€¢	us = 0.0 â†’ % in user space (normal programs).
	â€¢	sy = 0.3 â†’ % in system/kernel space.
	â€¢	ni = 0.0 â†’ % in user space with nice priority (background low-priority jobs).
	â€¢	id = 99.7 â†’ % idle time (CPU not doing anything).
	â€¢	wa = 0.0 â†’ % waiting for I/O (e.g., slow disk/network).
	â€¢	hi = 0.0 â†’ % servicing hardware interrupts.
	â€¢	si = 0.0 â†’ % servicing software interrupts.
	â€¢	st = 0.0 â†’ % stolen by hypervisor (VM host using CPU time).

4. Fourth line â€” Memory usage

MiB Mem :    957.4 total,    326.4 free,    357.4 used,    430.3 buff/cache

	â€¢	957.4 total â†’ Total system RAM.
	â€¢	326.4 free â†’ Completely unused memory.
	â€¢	357.4 used â†’ Memory in active use by programs.
	â€¢	430.3 buff/cache â†’ Memory used for disk cache/buffers (can be freed if apps need it).

5. Fifth line â€” Swap usage

MiB Swap:      0.0 total,      0.0 free,      0.0 used.    599.9 avail Mem

	â€¢	0.0 total â†’ No swap space configured.
	â€¢	0.0 used â†’ Swap not being used.
	â€¢	599.9 avail Mem â†’ Amount of RAM available for starting new applications without swapping.

ðŸ’¡ Key takeaway for your numbers:
	â€¢	Your CPU is almost fully idle (99.7% idle).
	â€¢	Memory usage is light â€” more than 300 MiB truly free and ~430 MiB in cache.
	â€¢	No swap is set up, but plenty of RAM is available.
	â€¢	System load is basically zero â€” machine is very free.

If you want, I can also make a color-coded diagram of top output so you can instantly know what each section means when you see it in real-time. That would make it stick forever.
