1.go to forked github-action  repo
2. ur project is pythn calculator their easy

here is  addition program and testing functionalty doing unit ttesting

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
    assert add(1, -1) == 0

3. writing pipline whnenee is commiting in the project piline will one a

4. as soon as we commit something it will checkout the progra m a and run
  run pipline which define to  make python enviroment beeause its self hosted doesnt define any server

 on jenkis uses server and vm node


 no node  here , where we need to define configuratuion inn easy machineew


 5.as soon as commit changews  there would be indiactor 


 which tells ur action is running

using plufin to checkuout the code and
'




step 8 after that its setup the python
step9. install dependsices but dont need 
step10 run tests 
step 11 post tests
and etc

      pr ek baar job toh ek job smia kuya krwana hai 



      Absolutely! Let’s break down your GitHub Actions workflow step by step so you understand the structure and purpose of each part. This YAML file automates testing Python code when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

---

## 🧩 Workflow Breakdown: `My First GitHub Actions`

### 📌 Workflow Name
```yaml
name: My First GitHub Actions
```
- This is just a label for your workflow. It helps you identify it in the GitHub Actions dashboard.

---

### 🚀 Trigger: When to Run
```yaml
on: 
  push:
    branches:
      - main
```
- This tells GitHub to run the workflow **only when code is pushed to the `main` branch**.
- You can change this to other branches or events like `pull_request`, `schedule`, etc.

---

### 🧱 Jobs Section
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
```
- A **job** is a set of steps that run on the same machine.
- You’ve named this job `build`, but it’s actually doing testing—naming is flexible.

---

### 🖥️ Runner Configuration
```yaml
runs-on: self-hosted
```
- This tells GitHub to run the job on a **self-hosted runner**, meaning a machine you manage (not GitHub’s cloud runners).
- You could also use `ubuntu-latest`, `windows-latest`, etc., if you want GitHub-hosted runners.

---

### 🧪 Strategy Matrix
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.8, 3.9]
```
- This runs the job **twice**, once with Python 3.8 and once with Python 3.9.
- Useful for testing compatibility across multiple Python versions.

---

### 📋 Steps: What the Job Does

#### 1. Checkout Code
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v3
```
- Downloads your repository code into the runner so it can be used in the next steps.

#### 2. Set Up Python
```yaml
- name: Set up Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v2
  with:
    python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
```
- Installs the specified Python version (3.8 or 3.9) for each matrix run.

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install pytest
```
- Upgrades `pip` and installs `pytest`, which is used for running tests.

#### 4. Run Tests
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    cd src
    python -m pytest addition.py
```
- Navigates to the `src` directory and runs tests in `addition.py` using `pytest`.

> 🔧 **Note:** Make sure `addition.py` contains valid test functions (e.g., functions prefixed with `test_`) for `pytest` to detect and run them.

---

Would you like help writing the actual test cases in `addition.py` or modifying this workflow to include test reports or coverage?



Bahut badhiya sawaal hai! Chaliye step-by-step samjhte hain:

---

## 🧱 `build:` kya batata hai?

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

- `build` ek **job ka naam** hai.
- `runs-on:` batata hai ki yeh job kis environment (OS) pe chalega.
  - `ubuntu-latest` → Linux-based system
  - `windows-latest` → Windows-based system
  - `macos-latest` → macOS system

### ❓ Hum Linux hi zyada kyun use karte hain?

- ✅ **Open-source & free**: Linux ka license free hai, isliye cost-effective hai.
- ⚡ **Fast & lightweight**: CI/CD ke liye Linux fast aur efficient hota hai.
- 🧰 **Tool compatibility**: DevOps tools jaise Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Python, etc. Linux pe best perform karte hain.
- 🔒 **Security**: Linux ka permission model strong hota hai.
- 🧪 **Testing-friendly**: Automated testing ke liye Linux ka setup easy hota hai.

---

## 🧠 `strategy` aur `matrix` kya karte hain?

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.8, 3.9]
```

### 🔄 Matrix ka kaam:
- Yeh ek **loop jaisa** kaam karta hai.
- Aap ek job ko **multiple configurations** ke saath run kara sakte ho.
- Upar wale example mein:
  - Job do baar chalega: ek baar Python 3.8 ke saath, ek baar Python 3.9 ke saath.

### 🧩 Strategy kya hota hai?
- `strategy:` ek umbrella hai jismein aap matrix define karte ho.
- Future mein aap aur cheezein bhi add kar sakte ho jaise OS combinations, environment flags, etc.

---

## 🧰 Matrix jese aur kya hota hai?

YAML workflows mein aur bhi powerful features hote hain:

| Feature        | Purpose |
|----------------|--------|
| `needs:`       | Ek job ko dusre job ke baad chalana |
| `if:`          | Conditional logic (e.g., sirf tab chalay jab koi file change ho) |
| `env:`         | Environment variables set karna |
| `timeout-minutes:` | Job ka max time limit set karna |
| `continue-on-error:` | Error ke baad bhi workflow continue karna |

---

Bahut hi zabardast sawaal! GitHub Actions mein `strategy` aur `matrix` ka use automation ko flexible aur powerful banane ke liye hota hai. Chaliye detail mein samjhte hain:

---

## 🧠 `strategy` ke andar kya-kya hota hai?

`strategy:` ek section hai jismein aap job ke execution ka plan banate ho. Iske andar commonly ye cheezein hoti hain:

### 🔁 1. `matrix`
Multiple configurations ke saath job run karne ke liye.

**Example:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]
```
➡️ Job teen baar chalega: har Python version ke saath.

---

### 🔄 2. `fail-fast`
Agar ek matrix job fail ho jaye, to baaki jobs ko rokne ke liye.

**Example:**
```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
```
➡️ Even if one job fails, others will continue running.

---

### ⏱️ 3. `max-parallel`
Ek time pe kitne matrix jobs parallel chal sakte hain.

**Example:**
```yaml
strategy:
  max-parallel: 2
```
➡️ Sirf 2 jobs ek saath chalenge, baaki queue mein rahenge.

---

## 🔢 `matrix` ke andar kya-kya define kar sakte hain?

Matrix ke andar aap multiple variables define kar sakte ho:

### ✅ 1. Multiple Python Versions
```yaml
matrix:
  python-version: [3.8, 3.9]
```

### 🖥️ 2. Multiple OS
```yaml
matrix:
  os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
```

### 🔀 3. Combine OS + Python
```yaml
matrix:
  os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
  python-version: [3.8, 3.9]
```
➡️ Total 4 combinations banenge:
- Ubuntu + 3.8
- Ubuntu + 3.9
- Windows + 3.8
- Windows + 3.9

---

### 🧪 4. Custom Flags
```yaml
matrix:
  include:
    - os: ubuntu-latest
      python-version: 3.8
      experimental: true
    - os: windows-latest
      python-version: 3.9
      experimental: false
```
➡️ Aap custom variables bhi define kar sakte ho jaise `experimental`.

---

## 🔍 Bonus: Conditional Matrix Jobs

Agar aap kuch combinations skip karna chahein:

```yaml
matrix:
  exclude:
    - os: windows-latest
      python-version: 3.8
```
➡️ Is combination ko skip kar diya jayega.

---

Agar chaaho toh main ek full example bana sakta ho jismein matrix ke saath OS, Python version, aur custom flags ho. Bologe toh turant bana ke dikhaata hoon!



whenvert got issue alwats check gitbhub action documention when need to build somthing like this  how to check for checout the code 
      
they are called plugin
 if using like chechout

 


<img width="1470" height="956" alt="Screenshot 2025-08-28 at 1 23 00 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5488834e-31b3-4c00-9cc2-6be6dc935f60" />

in documenation can see things like build and test in java with maven 

can see plugin how to use them etc'


in jenkis we weere insatlling plugin load to server

in this we just defined like setup pyton , and checkout code

usinf doc

github action does work automatically to run plugin

if use like setup python means for runbnning project using pyton insttal in github enibvormert to  test our work

\   we are just playing with plugin can use for any kind of projecgt like doing for node js
and ruby pythin just change some plugin thing will work very simple than jenkins

writing less code



 limitataion - its new technologu
 so only limited plugin but all need arew a\vailbale




 


 
bonus--- when u go in setting can see for github action setting

and can go in actions-> u will find runner and can use custom runner like ubuntu etyc whaterver u need 


when need like e when  we dont  like default runner and   we are not satsifef like doeent proive enough to run , doemst have enough computer resource etc 

they are light weight 

can do  new self-hosted  runner 


so there are other file like java dockern maven file
