You're sitting at 81% disk usage on `/dev/root`, which is tight enough to slow Jenkins down significantly. Let’s clean up your server and reclaim space smartly:

---

### 🧹 Step-by-Step Cleanup Guide

#### 1. **Clear Jenkins Build History**
Jenkins stores old builds that can pile up fast.
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/*/builds/*
```
> You can also configure Jenkins to automatically discard old builds under **Job → Configure → Build Discarder**.

---

#### 2. **Clean APT Cache (for Debian/Ubuntu)**
```bash
sudo apt-get clean
sudo apt-get autoremove
```
This removes cached packages and unused dependencies.

---

#### 3. **Remove Old Logs**
System logs can grow quietly in the background.
```bash
sudo journalctl --vacuum-time=7d
sudo rm -rf /var/log/*.gz /var/log/*.[0-9]
```

---

#### 4. **Check for Large Files**
Find and review the biggest files hogging space:
```bash
sudo du -ah / | sort -rh | head -n 20


Sure! Let's break down this command into simple parts so you can understand exactly what it's doing:

---

### 🧾 Full Command:
```bash
sudo du -ah / | sort -rh | head -n 20
```

This command helps you **find the top 20 largest files and folders** on your system starting from the root `/` directory.

---

### 🔍 Breakdown:

| Part | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `sudo` | Runs the command with **admin/root permissions**, so it can access all files |
| `du -ah /` | `du` means "disk usage" <br> `-a` includes **files and folders** <br> `-h` shows sizes in **human-readable format** (like MB, GB) <br> `/` means start checking from the **root directory** |
| `|` | This is a **pipe**, which sends the output of one command into the next |
| `sort -rh` | Sorts the list: <br> `-r` = reverse (largest first) <br> `-h` = human-readable format (so it understands MB, GB etc.) |
| `head -n 20` | Shows only the **top 20 results** from the sorted list |

---

### 📦 What You Get:
A list of the **20 biggest files or folders** on your system, like:
```
2.5G  /var/lib/docker
1.8G  /var/lib/jenkins
900M  /usr/lib
...
```

This helps you **quickly find what's eating up your disk space** so you can clean it up.

```
Delete what’s unnecessary—but be cautious with system files.

---

#### 5. **Clear Docker Images & Containers (if using Docker)**
```bash
docker system prune -a
```
This wipes unused containers, images, and networks.

---

#### 6. **Remove Temp Files**
```bash
sudo rm -rf /tmp/*
```

---

### 📊 Bonus: Monitor Disk Usage
Install `ncdu` for a visual breakdown:
```bash
sudo apt install ncdu
sudo ncdu /
```

---
You're absolutely right to notice — your Terraform folder is eating up **346 MB**, which is a big chunk considering your total disk space is only around 6.8 GB. Let me explain why this happens and how you can clean it up safely.

---

### 🧱 Why Terraform Is Using So Much Space

The bulk of the space is coming from this path:
```
./terraform/.terraform/providers/registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws/4.67.0/linux_amd64
```

This is where Terraform stores:
- **Downloaded provider binaries** (like AWS, Azure, etc.)
- **Plugin versions** for each project
- **Dependency metadata**

Every time you run `terraform init`, it downloads the required providers and stores them locally in `.terraform/`. If you work on multiple projects or reinitialize often, this folder can grow fast.

---

### 🧹 How to Clean It Up

#### ✅ Option 1: Delete `.terraform` Folder
If you're done with the project or want to reinitialize:
```bash
rm -rf ./terraform/.terraform
```
Then re-run:
```bash
terraform init
```
This will re-download only what’s needed.

---

#### ✅ Option 2: Use `terraform providers mirror` (Advanced)
You can mirror providers to a shared location and avoid downloading them repeatedly. Useful for CI/CD pipelines or multiple projects.

---

#### ✅ Option 3: Global Cleanup (if you have multiple projects)
Check your home directory:
```bash
du -sh ~/.terraform.d
```
You can clean it if it's large:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.terraform.d
```

---

### ⚠️ Be Careful
- Don’t delete `.tf` files — they contain your actual infrastructure code.
- Only remove `.terraform/` and `.terraform.d` if you're okay reinitializing.

Let me know your OS and whether Jenkins is running with Docker or natively—I can tailor this even more. Want help setting up auto-clean scripts?
Yes — the `.terraform` folder and its contents are automatically created **when you run Terraform scripts**, especially after using:

```bash
terraform init
```

This command downloads all required **providers**, **modules**, and **plugin binaries** (like the AWS provider you saw), and stores them locally in the `.terraform` directory. That’s why your disk showed 346 MB used just by Terraform — it’s caching everything needed to run your infrastructure code.

---

### 🧹 If You Want to Remove All Terraform-Related Files

Here’s what you can safely delete:

#### ✅ 1. **Project-specific Terraform cache**
```bash
rm -rf ./terraform/.terraform
```

#### ✅ 2. **Global Terraform config (optional)**
```bash
rm -rf ~/.terraform.d
```

#### ✅ 3. **Any `.tf` files or state files (only if you're done with the project)**
```bash
rm -rf *.tf *.tfstate*
```
> ⚠️ Be careful: `.tf` files are your actual infrastructure code. Only delete them if you no longer need the project.

---

### 🔁 Will It Come Back?
Yes — if you run `terraform init` again, it will recreate the `.terraform` folder and download providers again. That’s normal behavior.

-Absolutely! Let's break down the command `rm -rf *.tf *.tfstate*` in simple terms:

---

### 🧨 What This Command Does

```bash
rm -rf *.tf *.tfstate*
```

This command **forcefully deletes** certain Terraform-related files from your current directory.

---

### 🔍 Breakdown of Each Part

| Part | Meaning |
|------|--------|
| `rm` | Stands for "remove" — used to delete files or folders |
| `-r` | Recursive — needed if you're deleting folders (not used here but included just in case) |
| `-f` | Force — skips confirmation prompts and deletes without asking |
| `*.tf` | Deletes **all files ending in `.tf`** (Terraform configuration files) |
| `*.tfstate*` | Deletes **all files starting with `.tfstate`**, including `.tfstate`, `.tfstate.backup`, etc. |

---

### 🧱 What These Files Are

- **`.tf` files**: These are your **Terraform scripts** — they define infrastructure (like EC2, S3, VPC).
- **`.tfstate` files**: These store the **current state of your infrastructure** — Terraform uses them to track what’s deployed.

---

### ⚠️ Warning Before Running

- If you delete `.tf` files, you lose your infrastructure code.
- If you delete `.tfstate` files, Terraform forgets what it deployed — this can cause **conflicts or duplication** if you run scripts again.

---

### ✅ When It's Safe to Use

- You're cleaning up a test project
- You’ve backed up important files
- You want to reset Terraform and start fresh

---
Got it — you want to free up RAM on your Jenkins EC2 instance. Since your system has under 1 GB of RAM and most of it is already used, here's a focused cleanup plan to reclaim memory without breaking Jenkins or Docker:

---

### 🧠 Step-by-Step: Free Up RAM Safely

#### 1. **Stop Unnecessary Services**
Check what's running and stop anything non-essential:
```bash
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```
Then stop anything you don’t need:
```bash
sudo systemctl stop <service-name>
```

#### 2. **Kill Zombie or Idle Processes**
List processes by memory usage:
```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -20
```
Kill anything suspicious or idle:
```bash
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

#### 3. **Clear Cached Memory**
This won’t affect Jenkins or Docker:
```bash
sudo sync; echo 3 | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

#### 4. **Restart Jenkins & Docker (Optional but Effective)**
This can flush memory leaks:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

#### 5. **Monitor RAM Usage Live**
Use `htop` for a live view:
```bash
sudo apt-get install htop
htop
```

---

### ⚠️ Pro Tip: Avoid Over-Clearing

Don’t remove buffers/cache aggressively — Linux uses them to speed things up. Only drop caches if memory pressure is high.
