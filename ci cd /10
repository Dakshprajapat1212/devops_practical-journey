after old time pepole used fresstyle projects
In Jenkins, a **Freestyle Project** is the most basic and flexible type of job you can create. It’s perfect for simple automation tasks and gives you a lot of control over how your build runs.

---

### 🛠️ What Is a Freestyle Project?

A **Freestyle Project** lets you:
- Pull code from a source control system (like Git or SVN)
- Run build steps (like compiling code, running scripts, or executing shell commands)
- Archive artifacts (like compiled binaries or logs)
- Send notifications (email, Slack, etc.)
- Add post-build actions (like triggering other jobs)

### 🆚 Freestyle vs Pipeline

| Setup               | GUI-based                             | Script-based (`Jenkinsfile`)              |
| Flexibility         | Limited for complex workflows         | Highly flexible and scalable              |
| Best For            | Simple tasks and quick jobs           | Complex CI/CD pipelines                   |

People tend to avoid **Freestyle Projects in Jenkins** nowadays because software development and deployment have evolved—and Freestyle just hasn’t kept up. Here’s why it’s fallen out of favor:

---

### 🚫 Limitations of Freestyle Projects

#### 1. **Lack of Scalability**
- Freestyle jobs are great for simple tasks but struggle with complex workflows.
- You can’t easily model multi-step pipelines, parallel stages, or conditional logic.

#### 2. **No Code-as-Configuration**
- Everything is configured through the Jenkins UI.
- That means no version control for your build logic—unlike **Pipeline jobs**, which use `Jenkinsfile` stored in Git.

#### 3. **Harder to Maintain**
- If you have dozens of Freestyle jobs, updating them is manual and error-prone.
- Pipelines allow reusable shared libraries and templates.

#### 4. **Limited Integration**
- Freestyle doesn’t play well with modern tools like Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud-native services.
- Pipelines offer native support for containerized builds and deployments.

#### 5. **Poor Visibility and Traceability**
- You can’t easily visualize the build flow or track changes to job configurations.
- Pipelines provide clear stage views and audit trails.

### 🔄 What People Use Instead

| Feature Needed         | Freestyle Project | Pipeline Project |
|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Complex workflows      | ❌                | ✅               |
| Version-controlled CI  | ❌                | ✅               |
| Docker/K8s integration | ❌                | ✅               |
| Reusability            | ❌                | ✅               |
| Scalability            | ❌                | ✅               |

Version Control in this context means whether your job’s configuration lives as code alongside your project (in Git) or is stored only inside Jenkins’s own UI/database.

---

## Direct Answer

When you use a Pipeline, you write a `Jenkinsfile` that lives in your Git repository. Every change to your build-and-deploy logic is committed, reviewed, and tracked just like your application code. In Freestyle, all those settings sit inside Jenkins itself—there’s no Git history for them.

---

## Why “Stored and Versioned with Your Code” Matters

1. Configuration as Code  
   - Your pipeline definition is plain text (`Jenkinsfile`) in the same repo as your app.  
   - You can clone the repo anywhere, open the file, and see exactly how Jenkins will build, test, and deploy.

2. Audit Trail and Collaboration  
   - Every change to the pipeline goes through Git: commits, diffs, pull requests, peer reviews.  
   - You can roll back to a previous pipeline version if an update breaks your flow.

3. Environment-Specific Branching  
   - Each branch can have its own `Jenkinsfile`.  
   - Feature branches can experiment with new steps without touching the main pipeline.

4. Reproducibility  
   - A fresh checkout of your repo always brings along the exact pipeline logic that code needs.  
   - No more “it worked yesterday” mysteries caused by manual tweaks in Jenkins.

5. Disaster Recovery  
   - If your Jenkins master crashes or you rebuild it, you don’t lose your pipeline definitions—they’re safely stored in Git.

---

## Contrasting with Freestyle

- Freestyle job configs live in Jenkins’s internal `config.xml` and database.  
- Changes via the UI are not captured in your application repo.  
- There’s no built-in mechanism for code reviews or branching of job definitions.

---

## Going Deeper: Best Practices

- Store your `Jenkinsfile` at your repo’s root so Jenkins Multibranch Pipelines auto-detect it.  
- Use declarative syntax for readability and `options`, `triggers`, and `environment` blocks.  
- Leverage shared libraries for common logic across multiple repos.  
- Protect your `Jenkinsfile` changes with branch protection rules in GitHub/GitLab.

Want a side-by-side example of a Freestyle config vs. a simple declarative `Jenkinsfile`? I can draft one to illustrate how minimal the shift can be—and how much you gain in maintainability.t can be—and how much you gain in maintainability.
