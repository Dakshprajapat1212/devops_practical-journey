You're tapping into a really important question about DevOps architecture: **why do we often install Jenkins on local or cloud servers instead of using a fully managed cloud CI/CD service?** Let‚Äôs break it down.

## üß∞ Why Jenkins Is Often Installed Locally or on Cloud VMs

Jenkins is **open-source** and **self-hosted**, which means:
- You control everything: plugins, configurations, security, and scalability.
- You can run it on your laptop, a private server, or a cloud VM like AWS EC2.

But yes, that means:
- You have to manage the infrastructure.
- You need to configure agents (nodes) for builds.
- You handle updates, backups, and scaling.

This gives **maximum flexibility**, but also **maximum responsibility**.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Why Not Just Use a Cloud CI/CD Service?

You absolutely can! Services like:
- **GitHub Actions**
- **GitLab CI**
- **CircleCI**
- **Bitbucket Pipelines**
- **AWS CodeBuild**

‚Ä¶let you run builds and tests **directly in the cloud**, with no need to set up Jenkins or manage nodes. These are:
- Easier to start with
- Fully managed
- Scalable
- Integrated with your code repo

So why do people still use Jenkins?

## üîç Why Jenkins Still Makes Sense

| Reason                        | Jenkins Advantage                                                                 |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Custom Workflows**         | You can build complex pipelines with fine-grained control                         |
| **Plugin Ecosystem**         | Thousands of plugins for integrations, notifications, testing, deployment         |
| **Hybrid Environments**      | You can run builds on-prem, in cloud, or both                                     |
| **Enterprise Control**       | Companies with strict compliance or internal tools often prefer self-hosted CI    |
| **Cost Control**             | No per-minute billing like some cloud CI tools‚Äîjust pay for the VM/server         |

## üß† So Why All the Nodes?

Jenkins uses **agents (nodes)** to run jobs. You can:
- Run builds on the master (not recommended)
- Connect multiple agents for parallel builds
- Use Docker containers or Kubernetes pods as dynamic agents

Yes, it‚Äôs more setup‚Äîbut it gives you control over **where** and **how** your builds run.

---

## üöÄ TL;DR

If you want **simplicity and speed**, go with a cloud CI/CD service.  
If you want **control, customization, and flexibility**, Jenkins is still a powerhouse.

You don‚Äôt have to choose one forever‚Äîmany teams start with cloud CI and move to Jenkins when their needs grow. Or they use both.
