Based on the output you shared:

```bash
ps -ef | grep jenkins
ubuntu      7315    6417  0 05:37 pts/1    00:00:00 grep --color=auto jenkins
```

This only shows the `grep` command itself running—it does **not** confirm that Jenkins is running. If Jenkins were active, you'd see a process like:

```
jenkins   1234     1  0 05:00 ?    00:00:30 /usr/bin/java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war
```

## ✅ How to Check If Jenkins Is Running

Try these steps:

### 1. **Check Jenkins Service Status**
```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
This will show whether Jenkins is:
- `active (running)` ✅
- `inactive` ❌
- `failed` ❌

### 2. **Check Listening Port**
Jenkins usually runs on port `8080`. You can check if it's listening:
```bash
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 8080
```
or
```bash
sudo lsof -i :8080
```

### 3. **Try Accessing Jenkins in Browser**
If you're on a cloud VM (like AWS EC2), open:
```
http://<your-public-ip>:8080
```
Make sure port 8080 is allowed in your security group.
