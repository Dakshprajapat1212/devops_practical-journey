Great question! These terms‚Äî**inbound** and **outbound**‚Äîare used in networking, cloud security, and firewall configurations to describe the direction of traffic relative to a system or server.

## üö¶ Inbound vs Outbound Traffic

| Term       | Description                                                                 | Example Use Case                          |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Inbound**  | Traffic **coming into** your system from external sources                    | A user accessing your Jenkins dashboard via port 8080 |
| **Outbound** | Traffic **leaving** your system to external destinations                    | Your Jenkins server pulling code from GitHub |

## üîê In AWS Security Groups

In the video you're following, the instructor explains this clearly when setting up Jenkins on an EC2 instance:

- **Inbound Rules**:  
  These define what kind of traffic is allowed **into** your EC2 instance.  
  Example: Allowing TCP traffic on port `8080` so users can access Jenkins from their browser.

- **Outbound Rules**:  
  These define what kind of traffic is allowed **out of** your EC2 instance.  
  Example: Jenkins reaching out to GitHub or Docker Hub to fetch code or images.

By default, AWS allows **all outbound traffic** but **blocks inbound traffic**, which is why you need to manually allow port `8080` for Jenkins to be accessible from the outside world.

## üß† Real-World Analogy

Think of your EC2 instance like a house:
- **Inbound** is someone ringing your doorbell (trying to access your server).
- **Outbound** is you making a phone call or ordering food online (your server reaching out).
