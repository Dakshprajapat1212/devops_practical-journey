Got it Hannu ✅ — the error “A start job for unit jenkins.service has failed” means systemd couldn’t launch Jenkins. Right now, your override config might be breaking the service. Let’s debug this step by step:

⸻

🔍 Step 1: Check Jenkins logs

Run this to see why Jenkins failed:

sudo journalctl -u jenkins -xe

This will show the actual error message (like missing java, wrong path, port in use, etc.).

⸻

🔍 Step 2: Common reasons Jenkins fails to start
	1.	Java path wrong
	•	In your override, you used /usr/bin/java.
	•	Check if it exists:

which java
java -version


	•	If it doesn’t, you need to install Java:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y

Then use that Java path.

	2.	ExecStart override not cleared
	•	If you didn’t put ExecStart= (empty) before your custom ExecStart, systemd may fail because multiple ExecStart lines conflict.
✅ Correct format in /etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service.d/override.conf:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Djava.awt.headless=true \
  -jar /usr/share/java/jenkins.war \
  --webroot=/var/cache/jenkins/war \
  --httpPort=8080


	3.	Port already in use
	•	If port 8080 is already used, Jenkins won’t start. Check with:

sudo lsof -i :8080



⸻

🔍 Step 3: Reload and restart properly

After fixing override.conf:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins


⸻

⚡ Hannu, right now we need to see the exact error from Jenkins logs. Can you run:

sudo journalctl -u jenkins -xe | tail -n 30
Got it ✅ — right now you only have the JRE (runtime) but not the JDK (compiler).
That’s why javac is missing, and Jenkins needs the JDK to run properly.

To fix this, install the JDK:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk -y

(or if you prefer the headless version for servers:

sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk-headless -y
```)  

---

### After installing:
Check again:  
```bash
javac -version
java -version

Both should show 21.x.x.

⸻

👉 Once that’s working, restart Jenkins:

sudo systemctl restart jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins -l

It should now start without failing.

Do you want me to also show you how to set JAVA_HOME properly (in case Jenkins still can’t detect Java)?

Do you want me to also give you a clean rollback command to remove your override so Jenkins uses its default config (to quickly make it run again)?
